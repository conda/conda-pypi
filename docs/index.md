Welcome to the `conda-pypi` documentation!

`conda-pypi` provides better PyPI interoperability for the conda ecosystem.
It allows you to safely install PyPI packages in conda environments by
converting them to conda format when possible, while falling back to
traditional pip installation when needed.

The tool offers two main commands: `conda pypi install` for safer PyPI
package installation with an intelligent hybrid approach, and `conda pypi
convert` for converting PyPI packages to `.conda` format without installing
them. The smart installation strategy ensures that explicitly requested
packages come from PyPI while dependencies are sourced from conda channels
when available.

`conda-pypi` includes support for development workflows through editable
installations with the `-e` flag for local project directories.

`conda-pypi` also installs `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` marker files when you install
the plugin, discouraging direct `pip` use that can destabilize conda-managed
environments.
